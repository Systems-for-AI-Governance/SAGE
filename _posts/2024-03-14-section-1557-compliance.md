The "Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities" final rule, issued under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, was published by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on May 6, 2024, and became effective on July 5, 2024.

## Key Provisions

### Scope
The rule applies to health programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance from HHS, including health insurance issuers, state-based health insurance exchanges, and HHS health programs and activities.

### Prohibited Discrimination
Discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics), age, or disability in covered health programs or activities.

### Use of Decision Support Tools
Covered entities must not discriminate against any individual through the use of patient care decision support tools and are required to make reasonable efforts to identify and mitigate the risk of discrimination resulting from the use of such tools.

## How SAIGRC Ensures Compliance

SAIGRC helps healthcare organizations comply with this rule through the following modules:

### 1. Risk Management and Incident Reporting
Helps proactively identify and mitigate risks related to biased or discriminatory outcomes, ensuring equity in care delivery and compliance with nondiscrimination requirements.

### 2. Local Validation for Historically Marginalized Groups
Ensures AI models are tested and validated against diverse datasets, addressing potential disparities in healthcare outcomes for underrepresented groups.

### 3. Phased Rollout Plan
Guarantees equitable access to AI technologies during deployment, minimizing the risk of discriminatory implementation practices.

### 4. Define and Document Appropriate Use
Prevents misuse of AI applications by clearly defining acceptable use cases, reducing potential violations of patients' rights under Section 1557.

### 5. In-built Training Framework
Educates staff on how to use a given AI tool responsibly, fostering awareness of implicit bias and nondiscrimination practices in decision-making.

### 6. Inappropriate Use Protocols
Establishes guidelines for identifying and addressing discriminatory use of AI, ensuring swift corrective action to protect patients.

### 7. Continuous Monitoring of AI Performance and Work Environment
Detects and mitigates ongoing biases in AI tools, ensuring sustained compliance with nondiscrimination principles throughout the tool's lifecycle.

### 8. Regularly Scheduled Audits with Bias Detection Mechanisms
Provides a structured approach to reviewing AI systems for discriminatory patterns, maintaining accountability and compliance with legal standards.

### 9. Protocols for Decommissioning and Updating
Ensures outdated or biased AI systems are responsibly phased out or updated to meet current nondiscrimination and equity standards. If threshold performance metrics are not met, key stakeholders are alerted.
