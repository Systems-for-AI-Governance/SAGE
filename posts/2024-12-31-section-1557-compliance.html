                <p>The "Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities" final rule, issued under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, was published by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on May 6, 2024, and became effective on July 5, 2024.</p>

                <h2>Key Provisions</h2>

                <h3>Scope</h3>
                <p>The rule applies to health programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance from HHS, including health insurance issuers, state-based health insurance exchanges, and HHS health programs and activities.</p>

                <h3>Prohibited Discrimination</h3>
                <p>Discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics), age, or disability in covered health programs or activities.</p>

                <h3>Use of Decision Support Tools</h3>
                <p>Covered entities must not discriminate against any individual through the use of patient care decision support tools and are required to make reasonable efforts to identify and mitigate the risk of discrimination resulting from the use of such tools.</p>

                <h2>How SAIGRC Ensures Compliance</h2>
